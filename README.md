# VIN-for-CSPP

This is a project about solving constrained shortest path problem (CSPP) by an imitation learning (IL) method named value iteration network (VIN).

Contact me if you need dataset, too big to be uploaded here. Or you can generate dataset by running ./dataset/make_training_data_LP.py.

./domains/gridworld_LP.py provides toy examples for understanding how to solve CSPP.
